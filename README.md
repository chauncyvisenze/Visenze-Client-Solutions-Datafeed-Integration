# Visenze-Client-Solutions-Datafeed-Integration

Designed and optimized for large data files, this repository consists of two ways where you can index your catalogue with us. 

1. FTP upload: If you do not have many images and do not require real-time updates, FTP is an ideal way to upload your datafeed.
For detailed instructions, please refer to FTP_upload in this repo.  

2. DATA API: If you want to manage your image indexing almost in real-time (e.g to support fast moving fashion, flash sales,etc.), 
you can enhance your image indexing process by integrating with our Data API. For detailed instructions, please refer to Data_index_ API.  
3. Fashion_Recognition_Extraction: A data processing tool designed to enrich your metadata (fashion attributes and fashion style & occasion information) based on ViSenze fashion recognition API. The output of <i>Fashion_Recognition_Extraction</i> could then be used by <i>DATA API</i> and <i>FTP upload</i> to integrate your datafeed with ViSenze.
